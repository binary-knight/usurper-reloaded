4. **Multiple Characters** - Test with different player character builds
5. **Various Playstyles** - Try aggressive, diplomatic, and economic approaches

### Documentation
- Record interesting emergent behaviors and stories
- Note any performance issues or unusual behavior
- Document player feedback and emotional responses
- Track balance issues and difficulty spikes
- Log any bugs or system failures

### Success Criteria
The NPC AI system passes manual testing when:
- Players consistently report engaging, believable NPC interactions
- Emergent stories arise naturally during gameplay
- NPCs feel like real players with distinct personalities
- The world feels alive and responsive to player actions
- Performance remains smooth during extended play sessions
- No major bugs or balance issues are discovered

## Notes for Testers
- Play naturally - don't try to "game" the AI system
- Pay attention to your emotional responses to NPCs
- Note when NPCs surprise you (positively or negatively)
- Consider whether you'd want to play the game for many hours
- Think about replayability - would different playthroughs feel unique?
- Report both positive emergent behaviors and concerning patterns
