## About

Usurper Reborn brings the brutal medieval world of the original BBS classic to modern platforms. Every formula, every stat, every quirk from the original Pascal source has been meticulously preserved—and then we added layers upon layers of new content.

What began as a faithful port has evolved into something more: a game that explores themes of **memory, identity, loss, and transcendence** through the lens of a Buddhist-inspired philosophy: *"You are not a wave fighting the ocean. You ARE the ocean, dreaming of being a wave."*

**Original Creator**: Jakob Dangarden (1993)
**Source Preservation**: Rick Parrish, Daniel Zingaro
**Modern Recreation**: Built with C# and .NET 8.0
**License**: GNU General Public License v2 (GPL v2)

## The Story

You wake in a dormitory with no memory of who you are. A letter in your own handwriting warns you:

> *"The gods are broken. Corrupted. There are SEVEN SEALS hidden in the dungeons below. Collect them. Break the cycle. End the suffering. Trust no one. Especially not the Stranger. And remember this: You are not what you think you are. You never were."*

The letter crumbles to dust. But the words burn in your mind.

**Your Journey:**
- Explore the town of Dorashire and its many locations
- Descend into dungeons that grow darker and more dangerous
- Encounter the Old Gods—some imprisoned, some corrupted, all remembering
- Collect the Seven Seals to unlock the truth
- Discover what you really are... and what the "cycle" truly means
