# Usurper Reborn

## A Persistent Online Text RPG with a Living World

**v1.1.4 "Regalia"** | **FREE AND OPEN SOURCE** | **GPL v2**

130+ autonomous NPCs wake up, go to work, visit taverns, fall in love, get married, have children, age, and eventually die of old age, all while you're offline. Log back in, read the news feed, and discover that the blacksmith married the barmaid, the king was assassinated, or a new generation just came of age. The world doesn't wait for you.

## The Living World

The core of Usurper Reborn is a 24/7 agent-based simulation. NPCs aren't quest dispensers standing in place, they're goal-driven agents with personalities, memories, and opinions about each other and about you.

**Autonomous NPCs:** Each NPC has 13 personality traits, a memory system (30 memories per NPC, importance-weighted), and a goal-based AI brain. They choose careers, form gangs, visit shops, train at the guild, and develop relationships with each other independently of player action. NPCs react to neighbor density (Conway-inspired clustering), migrate when overcrowded, and form friend groups based on personality compatibility.

**Full Lifecycles:** Married NPCs can become pregnant, have children, and raise them. Children grow up over real time and eventually join the realm as new adult NPCs. Adults age according to their race's lifespan (Human ~30 days, Elf ~80 days, Orc ~22 days) and die permanently when their time comes. The population turns over. No one is permanent.

**Emergent Events:** Marriages, divorces, affairs, births, coming-of-age ceremonies, natural deaths, gang wars, and political upheavals all happen organically and appear in the live news feed on the website and in-game.

**Persistent Multiplayer:** Connect via browser, SSH, or any MUD client to a shared world backed by SQLite. Your actions affect other players. PvP arena, cross-player chat, leaderboards, guilds, group dungeons, world bosses, and a news feed that captures everything happening in the realm.

**Cross-platform Discord bridge:** In-game `/gos` lines mirror to a Discord channel and back, so the realm's gossip channel stays alive even when nobody is logged in.

## The Game

Beyond the simulation, there's a deep RPG with 100+ hours of content.

### Character Building
- **12 Base Classes + 5 Prestige Classes** (17 total): Warrior, Paladin, Assassin, Magician, Cleric, Ranger, Bard, Sage, Barbarian, Alchemist, Jester, Mystic Shaman, plus 5 NG+ prestige classes (Tidesworn, Wavecaller, Cyclebreaker, Abysswarden, Voidreaver) unlocked by completing different endings.
- **10 Races:** Human, Elf, Dwarf, Hobbit, Half-Elf, Orc, Gnome, Troll, Gnoll, Mutant, with race-specific lifespans, stats, and lore.
- **Specialization System:** Each class has 2 specializations (24 total) selectable at the Level Master, shaping NPC AI ability priorities and giving role-specific stat bonuses (Tank, DPS, Healer, Utility, Debuff).
- **75+ Spells** across caster classes, **44+ class abilities**, plus 5 universal abilities. Meaningful stat scaling with diminishing returns past natural caps.
- **Romantic orientation** (Straight / Gay / Bisexual / Asexual) selectable at character creation, affects NPC pool filtering for romance.

### 100-Floor Dungeon
- Deterministically generated floors with boss encounters, treasure rooms, traps, hidden secrets, settlements, meditation chambers, puzzles, and lever rooms.
- 7 corrupted Old Gods sealed in the depths (floors 25, 40, 55, 70, 85, 95, 100), each with multi-phase combat, channeled abilities, AoE mechanics, divine armor, and meaningful dialogue choices.
- 7 Ancient Seals to collect, unlocking the truth about who you are.
- 5 endings based on your choices: Conqueror, Savior, Defiant, True, and a secret Dissolution ending.
- Floor-aware monster loot with full per-slot armor coverage (head, arms, hands, legs, feet, waist, face, cloak, body, weapons, shields, rings, necklaces).
- Settlements at Floor 1 (NPC-built shops, services, vote-driven proposals).

### Story & Narrative
You wake with no memory. A letter in your own handwriting warns you: *"The gods are broken. Collect the Seven Seals. Break the cycle. You are not what you think you are."*

- **Ocean Philosophy:** A Buddhist-inspired awakening system with 7 levels: *"You are not a wave fighting the ocean. You ARE the ocean, dreaming of being a wave."*
- **5 Companions** who can die permanently: Lyris, Aldric, Mira, Vex, Melodia, each with personal quests, real grief consequences, and signature combat abilities.
- **NG+ Cycle System:** Each playthrough, you remember more. NPCs notice. Cycle 4+ players face stacking world modifiers (+monster HP/damage, +gold scaling).
- **6 Town NPCs with story arcs**, dream sequences, stranger encounters, and faction politics.

### Relationships & Politics
- Romance, marriage, children, divorce, affairs, polyamory.
- Challenge the throne, recruit guards, manage treasury, navigate court factions, set tax rates and city-control turf.
- 3 joinable factions: The Crown, The Shadows, The Faith.
- PvP arena with daily limits, gold theft, and leaderboards.
- Guild system with 8 chat commands, guild bank, member XP bonus, invite flow.
- Knighthood with combat buffs and Sir/Dame title prefix.

### Locations
30+ player-visitable locations: Main Street, Inn, Bank, Weapon Shop, Armor Shop, Magic Shop, Music Shop, Healer, Temple, Church, Dark Alley, Level Master, Marketplace, Castle, Castle Courtyard, Pantheon, Hall of the Ascended, Prison, Prison Walk, Anchor Road, Team Corner, Quest Hall, Dungeons, Home (with 5-tier upgrade system and tamed-beasts menagerie), Wilderness (with Druid's Shrines pilgrimage and beast-taming encounters), Outskirts settlement, Arena, and more.

### Mod Support & Game Editor
Opt-in JSON mods drop into a `GameData/` folder next to the executable: NPCs, monster families, dreams, achievements, dialogue lines, balance constants, custom equipment, and (since 1.2) the numbers on every built-in class ability and spell (`abilities.json`, `spells.json`, replace-by-key, a file with any invalid entry is rejected whole) are all overridable without a recompile. A bundled menu-driven editor (`UsurperReborn --editor`, or `[G] Game Editor` from the main menu in single-player) is the sysop-tool analogue of the DOS-era `USEDIT.EXE`: arrow-key / number-key navigation, edits saves and mods from one UI, auto-backs up before writes. See `DOCS/MODDING.md` for the full guide.

### Accessibility
- **Screen reader mode:** auto-detected on Windows for the standard console launch (NVDA / JAWS / Narrator), or pass `--screen-reader` explicitly. Strips box-drawing, decorative Unicode, color-bracketed menus; all locations have plain-text paths.
- **Compact mode:** smaller terminals (mobile SSH, narrow windows). Toggle with `[Z]` from any menu or `/compact`.
- **Steam launcher:** `Play.bat` is the default; `Play-Accessible.bat` opts into screen-reader mode at launch.
- **5 languages:** English, Spanish, French, Hungarian, Italian. Swap via in-game preferences. Per-character language preference saved.

### Graphical Client (Beta)
An optional Electron-based graphical client is in active development with Darkest Dungeon-style combat sprites, a dungeon map overlay, paperdoll inventory, party panels, status overlays, and an audio infrastructure layer (sound files filling in over time). Text mode remains the primary supported way to play.

## Origins

Originally inspired by *Usurper* (1993) by Jakob Dangarden, a classic BBS door game. The original Pascal source was preserved by Rick Parrish and Daniel Zingaro. Usurper Reborn maintains compatibility with the original formulas while building an entirely new simulation layer on top.

- **Starter Quests:** 11 pre-made quests spanning levels 1-100.
- **Open Contract Bounties:** Kill any NPC with a bounty and get paid immediately.
- **King's Bounties:** The reigning monarch posts bounties on criminals and NPCs.
- **Auto-Refresh:** Completed bounties are automatically replaced.
- **Difficulty Scaling:** Easy / Medium / Hard / Extreme tiers.

### Achievement System

Quick settings via the Preferences menu (compact, screen-reader, language, font size, date format, character/monster art, hide intimate scenes, etc.). All preferences saved per character.

## Estimated Playtime

| Playstyle | Hours | Description |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| **Casual** | 40-60 | Main story, reach level 50-60, see one ending |
| **Full Playthrough** | 100-150 | All seals, all gods defeated, multiple endings |
| **Completionist** | 200-400 | All achievements, all companions, all quests, level 100, multiple NG+ cycles |

*Playtime varies based on difficulty mode and exploration style.*

## How to Connect (Online)

The official server is `play.usurper-reborn.net`. Multiple connection paths:

- **Browser:** [usurper-reborn.net](https://usurper-reborn.net) with an embedded xterm.js terminal. No install. Easiest for new players.
- **SSH:** `ssh usurper@play.usurper-reborn.net -p 4000` (gateway password `play`). Once connected, you'll see the in-game register/login screen.
- **MUD client:** `play.usurper-reborn.net 4000` raw TCP. Mudlet, MUSHclient, TinTin++, etc. GMCP enabled (live HP/MP/SP gauges, room info, character status, chat capture).
- **Steam:** [Usurper Reborn on Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/4336570/Usurper_Reborn/), use the in-game `[O] Online Play` menu.
- **Standalone client:** Same as Steam, the `[O] Online Play` menu now opens a server picker (Official server pre-selected at `[1]`, or `[2]` to enter a custom hostname/port for a friend's server).

Each player has 3 free resurrections. Once those run out, the next death is permanent: the character is erased server-wide and the news feed records it. (Single-player saves are unaffected by online permadeath.)

## BBS Door Mode

Run Usurper Reborn as a door game on modern BBS software:

- **Auto-Detection:** Reads DOOR32.SYS and auto-configures. No special flags needed for most setups.
- **Fully Tested:** Synchronet (Standard I/O), EleBBS (Socket), Mystic BBS (Socket + SSH).
- **Should Work:** WWIV, GameSrv, ENiGMA, Renegade (NFU stdio).
- **Native Winsock I/O:** Bypasses .NET socket finalizers to fix the long-standing relaunch bug on EleBBS / Mystic.
- **DOOR32.SYS & DOOR.SYS:** Both drop-file formats supported.
- **Multi-Node Support:** Each node gets isolated session handling.
- **BBS-Isolated Saves:** Saves stored per-BBS so users on different BBSes don't conflict.
- **CP437 Auto-Detection:** Synchronet stdio mode automatically switches output encoding to CP437 for correct box-drawing.
- **SysOp Console:** In-game admin console for player management, difficulty settings, MOTD, online-play toggle, and auto-updates.
- **In-Game Bug Reports:** Players press `!` to submit bug reports directly from a BBS session, posted to Discord with player context.
- **Cross-Platform:** Windows x64/x86, Linux x64/ARM64, macOS.

**Quick Setup for Sysops:**
```bash
UsurperReborn --door32 <path>      # Just point it to your DOOR32.SYS
UsurperReborn --door32 <path> --online    # Local SQLite-backed shared world for THIS BBS's players
UsurperReborn --verbose            # Detailed debug output for troubleshooting
```

For detailed BBS setup, see [DOCS/BBS_DOOR_SETUP.md](DOCS/BBS_DOOR_SETUP.md).

**BBS Online Play:** A BBS player can pick `[O] Online Play` from the main menu to connect to the public game server (or any other Usurper Reborn server with a hostname they know). As of v0.60.8 the connection requires a normal username + password (the previous trusted-passthrough was removed for security; the BBS handle is pre-filled as the username default).

## Recent Highlights

The game ships small patches frequently. Each version has a dedicated release notes file under `DOCS/release-notes/` (Steam-formatted copies in `DOCS/release-notes/steam/`). Highlights of the recent arc:

- **v1.1.0 "Regalia":** the gear and reward loop. Items store their rarity and family instead of hiding the tier in a localized name; eight item families are gear sets with bonuses at two, four, and six pieces, for players and NPCs alike; the Black Market sells to your Dread standing with a rarity floor and a rarity premium, the level 20-40 gold sink the July analysis found missing; the NPC market no longer strips items it holds; two long-standing races in the equipment catalog are closed. See `DOCS/release-notes/RELEASE_NOTES_1.1.0.md`.
- **v1.1.1:** a bug pass. Five review agents each took a domain of the codebase and about seventy findings were verified and fixed: NPCs losing their innate power on load, the world simulator editing the wrong player's relationships, a restored character unable to save, one player's autosave starving everyone else's, the Black Market re-rolling on relog, a closed connection spinning the server, bank and gambling exploits, buffs consumed a fight early, and raw placeholders in the text. See `DOCS/release-notes/RELEASE_NOTES_1.1.1.md`.
- **v1.1.2:** seven of the eight open design items, each designed twice (Codex and Claude), reconciled against the code, and reviewed before implementation: grouped followers get their own cooldowns and a real death; haggling finally has a way in and its attempts persist; the bank vault is one persisted reserve per world, atomic online; relationships cool with neglect measured in days you were present; NPCs left to die while you held a heal remember it; ability and spell numbers are moddable from `GameData/`; the two intimacy lines that really dropped a name are fixed. Docker stack refreshed and verified. See `DOCS/release-notes/RELEASE_NOTES_1.1.2.md`.
- **v1.1.3:** party survivability. Wounded allies shield up, brace (half damage on ordinary hits, specials, and life drain), and drink their own potion first; NPC allies who die in your party roll the 2 percent team permadeath rate they were always meant to; three stances per ally (Aggressive, Balanced, Cautious) set from the dungeon party menu or the Inn and saved with the character; monsters no longer prefer a wounded target and an ally's brace no longer pulls hits unless it is Aggressive; a shared potion belt (off by default, two loans per fight, never the player's last three), give-a-number, and the one-personal-potion rule; a fight summary per ally, a warning before a voluntary fight with an ally below 30 percent, and a floor guard that offers Cautious to an ally eleven levels behind. Planned by a council of Codex, a Claude design agent, and the supervisor session in `DOCS/PARTY_SURVIVABILITY_PLAN.md`; the downed state is the next release.
- **v1.1.4:** the world boss, redone, first half. It comes every evening at 8 PM Eastern whether anyone is online or not, chosen to suit the median level of the last week's players, with a countdown on the town screen, mail to everyone active, news, Discord, and a call an hour before; it withdraws with its wounds if it survives its three-hour window and returns for up to three nights. Its health is a three-fighter budget instead of a population multiplier under the 2.25 difficulty scale (462 thousand for the smallest boss with two online); it meets a lower-level player at their level; blows are capped per round; the one-session lock and the unavoidable aura are gone; a boss left alone heals. Rewards by effort at the player's own level, worth about a dungeon hour, items by contribution, a quarter share on a withdrawal, settled once into a ledger and delivered by the player's own session online or offline, plus a day of extra experience for the realm. Planned by the council in `DOCS/WORLD_BOSS_PLAN.md`; the fight itself (telegraphs, interrupts, focus) is 1.1.5.
- **v1.0.0 "Coronation":** the release. The Beta label comes off. Nothing in this version is a new subsystem; it is the accumulated result of the Countdown arc below plus a final hardening pass: the level-40 progression cliff closed end to end (XP taper through level 40, boss-flee desperation scaling, a guarded round after a failed flee, and the Hall of the Fallen memorial that hands a fallen character's heir a level-scaled inheritance), the login gate and permadeath cinematic fully localized in all five languages, AI-painted NPC portraits rendered at full fidelity for terminals that can carry them, and an external security audit answered in full. See `DOCS/release-notes/RELEASE_NOTES_1.0.0.md`.
- **v0.62 through v0.65 (the Beta to 1.0 "Countdown" arc):** the alignment / Light-and-Dark payoff pass (Dread and Renown notoriety ladders, the Sellsword Hall freelance career, the Sanctum light hub, Dark Alley depth); the "Bloodlines" multi-generational family arc (adult children recognize you as their parent, dynasty standing, inheritance on permadeath); the NPC "Brain v2" overhaul (goal-aware utility scorer, real combat for notable NPCs, optional server-side LLM moment generators with a heuristic fallback that always works); a haproxy migration for the online server; a big onboarding pass (guided first fight, guaranteed level 2, progression roadmap screen); player class specializations at level 25; and companion three-beat quest chains ("The Long Road"). See the individual `DOCS/release-notes/RELEASE_NOTES_0.6*.md` files for detail.
- **v0.61.4 (Dynamic NPC Dialogue Phase 1.5 + Hungarian end-to-end + Steam achievement coverage):** Phase 1.5 of the dynamic NPC dialogue plan. Seven contextual flavor layers (mood, memory, witness, player-state, grief, personality, faction-tension) tone-coherent via a Tone classification on the mood layer that downstream layers consult, recent-line variety cache keyed per-(npc, layer), romance-partner suppression for the faction layer. Wired into `ShowGreeting`, `ShowFarewell`, `HandleChatTopic`, and `HandlePersonalQuestion`. **Hungarian end-to-end:** 175 VN dialogue template strings + 114 enhancer flavor pool strings extracted to `dialogue.vn.*` and `dialogue.enhance.*` loc keys with full Hungarian translations. Language gate widened from English-only to en+hu. Hungarian players now get the complete contextual-dialogue experience. **Steam achievement coverage: 79/79 live.** One previously-unreachable in-game achievement (`big_spender_magic`) wired up, and 30 in-game achievements that had never been registered on the Steamworks Partner dashboard are now live with unique icon art per achievement (tier-appropriate frames: Diamond rainbow / Platinum / ornate gold / polished silver / bronze; visual progression sets for the Gauntlet tier, login-streak, and world-boss series). The `bouny_hunter` typo on the Steam side corrected to `bounty_hunter`. Plus rolled-in hotfix work: 12 pre-existing v0.60.0 corrupted loc keys fixed (dungeon advice, duel decline, attack treacherous, breadcrumb -- they shipped with literal `"  \\"` placeholder values and never got real content); stuck player-echo recruitment auto-cleanup at dungeon entry + visible recruited-list at Team Corner + new `[U]` un-recruit hotkey; dungeon feature gold-split bug (companions/NPCs were eating the player's gold reward, now grouped-players-only); class names localized everywhere (`Character.ClassName` now routes through `Loc.Get` so all ~15 display sites pick up session language); bug-report cancel hint surfaced; 10 login-streak messages localized.
- **v0.61.0 (Wilderness Reborn):** Two new systems folded into the wilderness. **Druid's Shrines** -- 5 named shrines (one per remaining Old God: Terravok, Maelketh, Noctura, Aurelion, Veloura), each in a wilderness region, granting a 24-hour combat passive on attunement (HP regen / melee damage / crit + backstab / holy damage / charisma + reaction). One attunement at a time with alignment cost; per-shrine favor counter; favor-10 milestone grants a permanent stat lift themed to the god's domain. **Beast Taming** -- 8 tameable wild creatures, permanent roster (cap 8), per-encounter 3-attempt CHA+DEX skill check. 6 passives (hawk map-reveal, goat fatigue reduction, toad poison resist + daily antidote, sprite mana regen, spider crit + reaction penalty, wisp shadow proc + opening-fight Hidden) and 2 combat pets (Dire Wolf + Storm Eagle) that occupy a brand-new 5th party slot in dungeon combat. Plus a street-encounter NPC murder-cap bypass fix (was uncapped, now real-NPC kills count toward the 3/day limit), and the newborn notification text correction (children live at Home, not Love Corner). All 66 new keys translated into Spanish, French, Italian, Hungarian.
- **v0.60.x (Beta launch and post-launch hardening):** Online server wipe, founder statues for the 11 alpha-era pioneers, GMCP support for modern MUD clients, online-mode death system with 3 free resurrections, royal-guard arrest combat (replacing the phantom-arrest debuff), tank rebalance (75%-sticky AoE taunts), full ban-system rewrite (account + IP + CIDR + active-session kick + permadeath world-state purge), Discord bridge with login/logout announcements, server picker in `[O] Online Play`, AUTH security fix (loopback-only trusted auth), SR auto-detect false-positive fix on Steam and BBS. The Gauntlet redesigned (v0.60.11) as a 7-champion gladiatorial arena with herald entrances, surrender option, tier-titled completions, daily run cap, and quadratic entry fee.
- **v0.57.x (Alignment, Shields, and many hotfix rollups):** Paired chivalry/darkness movement, Temple Confession path, "Balanced" alignment with both-sides shop discounts, shield-required tank abilities, Warrior Shield Bash, Paladin Holy Shield Slam, save-file repair tooling, save-file resilience pass.
- **v0.56.x (Class Completeness + Difficulty Tuning):** Tank second-taunt abilities at level 40, healer onboarding (Curative Tincture, Mending Meditation, etc.), Tidesworn cohesion, champion / floor-boss / Old God rebalance, stamina-mana economy.
- **v0.55.x (The Specialist):** 24 NPC class specializations (2 per class), spec-driven AI ability priorities.
- **v0.54.x (The Soul Update):** Equipment system overhaul, NPC system overhaul, comprehensive gameplay audit (17 fixes), Vex timed death, Awakening Moments integrated, moments of silence after profound events, NPC dungeon idle comments, dynamic location flavor, moddable game data system phase 1.
- **v0.53.x (Ancestral Spirits):** Mystic Shaman class, comprehensive class/spell audit, relationship system audit, king/prison overhaul, Alethia lore woven through dungeon fragments, ELectron client DD-style combat UI.

For per-version detail, see the dedicated release notes in `DOCS/`. The complete in-CLAUDE.md changelog ships with every clone for archeological purposes.

## Versions Skipped on Purpose

- **0.58.x and 0.59.x:** originally reserved for the Electron graphical client roadmap. That work folded into beta, so the version number jumped straight from 0.57.x to 0.60.0.

## Acknowledgments

- **Jakob Dangarden:** Created the original *Usurper* (1993), the seed this grew from.
- **Rick Parrish:** Preserved the Pascal source code.
- **Daniel Zingaro:** Tremendous help with the Pascal source.
- **Coosh:** Community code contributor. Diagnosed an XP-formula desync from his own soft-locked Lv.73 character, traced it to 12 duplicated copies of the same function across the codebase, and submitted PR #98 centralizing them into one canonical implementation.
- **Xykier, DJLunacy, evanofficial, maxsond, LowLevelJavaCoder:** Community PRs covering combat loot party switching, smart sell filters, companion auto-equip, screen-reader preference persistence, shield loot generation, and the murder-mechanics rework.
- **The 11 alpha-era founders** commemorated in the Hall of the Ascended (in-game, `/founders`).
- **The BBS Community:** For keeping the spirit alive.
- **All players, testers, and bug reporters** who made beta possible.

## Known Issues (v1.1.4)

- Save files from the earliest alpha versions may not be fully compatible.
- BBS FOSSIL mode not natively supported (use `--stdio` flag for FOSSIL-based BBSes via host pipe).
- Steam features only work when the game is launched through the Steam client.
- The Electron graphical client is optional and still incomplete; the terminal client is the supported way to play.
- The Electron client has no party menu: ally stances and the shared potion belt are set from the terminal client.
- World news feed entries are stored pre-rendered in English. Interface, dialogue, and gameplay text are fully localized in all five languages; the news feed is not yet.
- Auto-updater for Linux x64 BBS deployments doesn't currently apply the update (under investigation).
