# Usurper: The Eternal Throne
## Complete Game Design Document - Narrative, Endgame & Prestige System

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Transform Usurper from a sandbox BBS door game into a complete single-player RPG experience with:
- **20-40 hours** of core campaign content
- **Narrative-driven progression** with meaningful choices
- **Three distinct endings** based on player alignment and choices
- **Prestige system (Eternal Cycles)** for replayability
- **Level 100 cap** for mortals, with godhood as endgame transformation
- **Final confrontation** with corrupted Old Gods threatening the realm

---

## PART 1: THE HOOK (First 30 Minutes)

### Opening Sequence

The player awakens in the **Dormitory** with fragmented memories. A mysterious stranger (revealed later as a fallen god) leaves a cryptic note:

```
"The old gods are dying. The throne sits empty.
In seven days, the Veil will tear.
You are the last hope... or the final doom.
Choose wisely, mortal."
```

### Immediate Goals (Tutorial Phase)
1. **Survive** - Find food, shelter, basic equipment
2. **Establish Identity** - Choose name, class, appearance
3. **First Blood** - Kill your first monster in the dungeon (level 1)
4. **First Friend or Enemy** - Encounter an NPC who remembers you differently based on your first choice

### The Hook Mechanism
Within the first 30 minutes, the player experiences:
- A **romantic/friendship encounter** at the Inn (emotional investment)
- A **mysterious death** they witness (plot hook)
- A **power surge** - strange abilities awakening (progression tease)
- A **choice with consequences** - save someone or take their gold

---

## PART 3: THE CAMPAIGN (Levels 50-100)

### The Old Gods Arc

#### The Lore
Before mortals, seven gods ruled the realm:

| God | Domain | Status | Path |
|-----|--------|--------|------|
| **Maelketh** | War & Conquest | Corrupted | Must be defeated |
| **Veloura** | Love & Passion | Dying | Can be saved or consumed |
| **Thorgrim** | Law & Order | Corrupted | Must be defeated |
| **Noctura** | Shadow & Secrets | Neutral | Can be allied or opposed |
| **Aurelion** | Light & Truth | Dying | Can be saved or consumed |
| **Terravok** | Earth & Endurance | Sleeping | Can be awakened |
| **Manwe** | Creation & Balance | Unknown | The final truth |

The gods grew corrupt over millennia. The **Sundering** shattered their power, trapping fragments in the mortal realm. Now those fragments reform—twisted, mad, and hungry.

---

### Act 1: The Awakening (Levels 50-65)

**Main Quest:** "The Shattered Divine"

Three artifacts appear across the realm. Each is a fragment of godly power:
1. **The Crown of Maelketh** - Found in dungeon floor 50 (boss fight)
2. **The Heart of Veloura** - Hidden in the Love Corner (romantic questline)
3. **The Scales of Thorgrim** - Held by the current King (political questline)

**Player Choice:**
- Collect all three to gain power
- Destroy them to weaken the gods
- Use them to bargain with the gods

**Consequence:** This choice determines which ending becomes available.

---

### Act 2: The Corruption (Levels 65-85)

**Main Quest:** "When Gods Bleed"

The Old Gods fully manifest. The realm transforms:
- **Dungeon floors 50-75** become twisted god-realms
- NPCs begin acting strangely (possessed by divine fragments)
- The player must choose which god to confront first

**Boss Encounters:**
1. **Maelketh, The Broken Blade** (Dungeon Floor 60)
   - Aggressive, military tactics
   - Rewards: War-aspected powers

2. **Thorgrim, The Hollow Judge** (Castle Throne Room)
   - Must be King to challenge, or sneak in
   - Rewards: Order-aspected powers

3. **Veloura, The Withered Heart** (Love Corner/Home)
   - Tied to romantic storyline
   - Can be saved instead of killed
   - Rewards: Passion-aspected powers OR a loyal divine ally

**The Twist:** Defeating gods doesn't end them—their power flows into YOU.

---

### Act 3: The Ascension (Levels 85-100)

**Main Quest:** "The Weight of Divinity"

The player now holds divine power. But so do others.

**Revelation:** The mysterious stranger from the beginning is **Noctura**, who orchestrated everything. She reveals:

> "You were never meant to save the realm. You were meant to REPLACE the gods. The old must die for the new to be born. But will you rule... or will you serve?"

**Three Paths Emerge:**

1. **The Usurper Path** (High Darkness)
   - Consume the remaining gods
   - Overthrow Manwe, the Creator
   - Become the sole god of a remade world

2. **The Savior Path** (High Chivalry)
   - Restore the dying gods (Veloura, Aurelion)
   - Forge a new pantheon
   - Sacrifice your mortality for balance

3. **The Defiant Path** (Balanced/Rejection)
   - Reject godhood entirely
   - Slay ALL gods, including Manwe
   - Return magic to mortals
   - Remain human—but legendary

---

## PART 4: THE ENDGAME (Level 100 + God Ascension)

### The Final Trial

**Location:** Heaven (Floor 401) - Rurforium, Domain of the Supreme Creator

**The Approach:**
- Dungeon Floor 100 is the gateway
- A final gauntlet of memories (boss rush of all defeated enemies)
- Companions from the journey can join (based on relationships)

**The Confrontation with Manwe:**

Manwe is not evil—he is *tired*. The Creator speaks:

> "I have watched mortals rise and fall for ten thousand years. I created the gods to guide you, but they grew cruel. I have waited for one who could either FIX what I broke... or END what I started. What say you, child of dust?"

**Three Final Choices:**

---

### ENDING A: "The Eternal Throne" (Usurper Path)

> You consume Manwe's power, becoming the new Supreme Creator. The old world burns; a new one rises from the ashes—shaped by YOUR vision.

**Epilogue:**
- The player becomes the central god
- NPCs from the game become lesser deities or favored mortals
- A new age begins under your rule

**Credits Text:**
```
In the end, there was only one throne that mattered.
Not of gold. Not of iron.
The throne of creation itself.

And [PLAYER NAME] sits eternal.

THE END... or is it THE BEGINNING?
```

**Post-Credits:** "Would you like to see how your reign unfolds? [Begin Eternal Cycle]"

---

### ENDING B: "The Redeemed Pantheon" (Savior Path)

> You sacrifice your chance at supreme power to restore balance. The gods you saved stand beside you as equals in a new pantheon. Mortality fades, but so does the loneliness of godhood.

**Epilogue:**
- Veloura and Aurelion are restored
- The player joins as God of [chosen domain]
- A council of gods now guides the realm
- Your mortal loved ones are blessed with long life

**Credits Text:**
```
They say the gods walk among us still.
That sometimes, in moments of love or courage,
You can feel their presence.

[PLAYER NAME] chose sacrifice over dominion.
And so, divinity was saved.

THE END... but gods do not truly die.
```

**Post-Credits:** "The heavens await your guidance. [Begin Divine Cycle]"

---

### ENDING C: "The Mortal Victory" (Defiant Path)

> You reject godhood and slay Manwe. All divine power shatters, flowing back into the world as raw magic. The age of gods ends. The age of mortals begins.

**Epilogue:**
- Magic becomes accessible to all
- The church collapses (no gods to worship)
- You age normally but are remembered forever
- Final scene: Old and gray, surrounded by grandchildren, telling the tale

**Credits Text:**
```
There are no more gods.
There are only the stories we tell,
And the choices we make.

[PLAYER NAME] chose humanity over eternity.
Some call it foolish.
Others call it the bravest act in history.

THE END... and every ending is a new beginning.
```

**Post-Credits:** "Your legend echoes through time. [Begin Legacy Cycle]"

---

## PART 5: THE PRESTIGE SYSTEM (Eternal Cycles)

### Core Concept

After completing the game, players can begin an **Eternal Cycle**—a New Game+ with escalating challenges and new content.

### Cycle Types (Based on Ending)

| Ending | Cycle Type | Unique Features |
|--------|-----------|-----------------|
| Usurper | **Eternal Cycle** | Play as a god guiding a new mortal champion |
| Savior | **Divine Cycle** | Play in the new pantheon, divine politics |
| Defiant | **Legacy Cycle** | Play as a descendant, magic is everywhere |

---

**Cycle 10+:**

- Manwe speaks to you differently ("Ah, you return...")
- Secret ending becomes achievable

---

### The Secret Ending (Cycle 10+)

**Requirements:**
- Complete all three ending types at least once
- Reach Cycle 10
- Find the 7 Fragments of Truth (hidden items)
- Choose the new dialogue option with Manwe

**The Truth:**
> "You wonder why you keep returning. Why death does not claim you. Let me show you the truth, old friend. You are not the first to sit this throne. You ARE Manwe. You divided yourself into mortality to understand why your creations suffer. Every cycle, you live a human life. Every cycle, you learn. Now... do you wish to remember EVERYTHING? Or forget one final time?"

**Secret Ending: "The Awakening"**

The player remembers all their cycles. All their lives. They were the Creator all along, living through every hero's journey to understand mortality.

**Choice:**
- **Remember** (become whole, watch from above as the world continues)
- **Forget** (begin anew, the cycle eternal, finding joy in the journey)

**Credits Text (Remember):**
```
In the beginning, there was nothing.
Then there was thought.
Then there was... you.

You have always been here.
You will always be here.
The stories mortals tell—you lived them all.

Welcome home, Creator.

TRUE END
```

**Credits Text (Forget):**
```
Some say the gods are cruel.
Others say they are indifferent.
But perhaps... they simply love the story too much to end it.

See you next cycle, old friend.

...LOADING NEW GAME...
```

## PART 6: PUZZLE & MYSTERY ELEMENTS

2. **Seal of Passion** (Romance questline) - Veloura's tragedy
3. **Seal of Law** (Become King) - Thorgrim's corruption
