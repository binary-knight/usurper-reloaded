# Phase 6: Shop System Implementation - Complete Pascal-Compatible Trading

## üõçÔ∏è Overview
Successfully implemented the complete Usurper shop system based on Pascal `WEAPSHOP.PAS` and `ARMSHOP.PAS` with full compatibility, haggling mechanics, and dual shopkeeper personalities.

## üéØ Core Implementation

### **HagglingEngine.cs** - Pascal HAGGLEC.PAS System
```csharp
// Charisma-based haggling success rates (exact Pascal formula)
int maxAllowedDiscount = player.Charisma switch
{
    >= 201 => 20,    // 201+ charisma: up to 20% discount
    >= 176 => 17,    // 176-200 charisma: up to 17% discount  
    >= 126 => 13,    // 126-175 charisma: up to 13% discount
    >= 76 => 10,     // 76-125 charisma: up to 10% discount
    >= 26 => 7,      // 26-75 charisma: up to 7% discount
    _ => 4           // 1-25 charisma: up to 4% discount
};
```

**Key Features:**
- **Daily Haggling Limits**: 3 attempts per shop per day (WeapHag, ArmHag counters)
- **Charisma-Based Success**: Exact Pascal formula for discount percentages
- **Maximum 20% Discount**: Hard limit as per original game
- **Shop Kick-Out System**: Players get kicked out for excessive haggling
- **Race Bonuses**: Trolls get 10% discount at weapon shop (no haggling allowed after)
- **Daily Reset Integration**: Automatic restoration of haggling attempts

### **WeaponShopLocation.cs** - Pascal WEAPSHOP.PAS
```csharp
// Tully the Troll - Exact Pascal shopkeeper personality
string shopkeeperName = "Tully"; // Configurable via cfg_string(15)

// Pascal troll race bonus
if (currentPlayer.Race == CharacterRace.Troll)
{
    finalPrice = HagglingEngine.ApplyRaceDiscount(currentPlayer, weapon.Value);
    terminal.WriteLine("Hey, we trolls gotta stick together!");
    terminal.WriteLine("Therefore I will give ya a discount!");
}
```

**Complete Menu System:**
- **(R)eturn to street** - Navigation back to Main Street
- **(B)uy** - Purchase specific weapon by number
- **(T)he best weapon** - Auto-purchase best affordable weapon
- **(S)ell** - Sell current weapon for half value
- **(L)ist items** - Paginated weapon catalog with prices

**Pascal Compatibility Features:**
- **Classic Mode**: Single weapon slot restriction
- **Weapon Restrictions**: Get rid of old weapon first
- **Price Display**: Exact Pascal formatting with dots
- **News Integration**: Purchase announcements
- **Troll Interaction**: Special dialogue and discounts

### **ArmorShopLocation.cs** - Pascal ARMSHOP.PAS
```csharp
// Reese the Merchant - Pascal shopkeeper with mysterious background
string shopkeeperName = "Reese"; // Configurable via cfg_string(16)

// Pascal shop atmosphere
terminal.WriteLine("As you enter the store you notice a strange but appealing smell.");
terminal.WriteLine("You recall that some merchants use magic elixirs to make their selling easier...");
```

**Advanced Features:**
- **Multi-Slot Equipment**: Head, Body, Arms, Hands, Legs, Feet, Face, Shield, Cloak
- **Equipment Helper**: "(1) ask Reese to help you with your equipment!"
- **Auto-Equipment System**: Analyzes needs and buys best gear within budget
- **Priority System**: Body armor (10), Shield (8), Legs (6), Head (5), etc.
- **Classic/New Mode**: Dual interface support

### **Enhanced Item System Integration**
```csharp
// Shop-specific ItemManager methods
public static ClassicWeapon GetWeapon(int weaponId)
public static ClassicArmor GetArmor(int armorId) 
public static List<ClassicWeapon> GetShopWeapons()
public static List<ClassicArmor> GetShopArmors()
public static ClassicWeapon GetBestAffordableWeapon(long maxGold, Character player)
public static ClassicArmor GetBestAffordableArmor(ObjType armorType, long maxGold, Character player)
```

## üîß Advanced Systems

### **Daily System Integration**
```csharp
// DailySystemManager.cs integration
HagglingEngine.ResetDailyHaggling(player);
terminal.WriteLine("Shop haggling attempts have been reset!", "bright_green");
```

**Daily Reset Features:**
- **Haggling Restoration**: WeapHag and ArmHag reset to 3
- **Turn Restoration**: Daily turn limits reset
- **News Integration**: Shop-related daily events

### **Character Integration**
Updated `Character.cs` with Pascal haggling counters:
```csharp
public byte WeapHag { get; set; } = 3;          // weapon shop haggling attempts left
public byte ArmHag { get; set; } = 3;           // armor shop haggling attempts left
```

### **Location Navigation Integration**
```csharp
// LocationManager.cs - Pascal ONLINE.PAS navigation
navigationTable[GameLocation.MainStreet] = new List<GameLocation>
{
    GameLocation.WeaponShop,   // loc7
    GameLocation.ArmorShop,    // loc8
    // ... other locations
};

// Shop exits back to Main Street
navigationTable[GameLocation.WeaponShop] = new List<GameLocation>
{
    GameLocation.MainStreet   // loc1
};
```
